-You are trapped in a part of the cosmos and your rocket will explode for no reason in a short while.

-You have to find a star(the shape, not the other meaning that refers to the sun) that will help you escape. It can generate anywhere on the map except for the starting space.

-Your rocket can only take 5 hits

-Black holes might generate in some areas which
will pull you towards them and teleport you back to the start of the map ([0][0]) and at the same time take away twice as much hitpoints.

-Hitting an obstacle except for a black hole will reverse your current velocity (propel you in the opposite direction, ah yes realistic physics);

-Note: the lower your hitpoints, the faster your accleration

GOOD LUCK!!
